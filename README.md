## About the projects
Welcome to CryptoFunding, my first complete smart contract project, a basic crowdfunding smart contract project that I developed as part of my learning journey through FCC. This project marks a significant milestone in my journey to become a blockchain dev. 

-   With CryptoFunding, contributors will become a part of the contract network when they fund it.
-   Withdrawing in CryptoFunding is only available to the owner of the contract.
